<h3 align="center">Minesweeper Flags</h3>

<p align="center">Inspired by the 2-player game Minesweeper Flags from the defunct chat application MSN messenger, popular in the early 2000s</p>

## How to Play
* There are 51 mines hidden in the game board, your aim is to click and find all the mines before your opponent does. Finding a mine gives you 1 point, and the player who reaches 26 points first wins. If the cell you click on does not contain a mine, it will show the number of mines in the surrounding 8 cells. Good luck and all the best!

## Functionalities

* 2-player mode on the same computer
* Special 5x5 bomb move by clicking on player portraits (unlimited number of bombs)
* Test your skill against a simple AI (at Blue Player) by clicking on the game title before making Red Player's move

## Acknowledgments

* Grateful for feedback from my course instructor, instructional assistants, and fellow coursemates
* Nat's mouse was particularly helpful in playtesting
